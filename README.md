# article-quiz
Every article (a/the) is removed from the selected element on the current webpage. Guess the original article used. See how well you did from a given score.

## TODO
- refactor architecture (no spaghetti and global obj polution)
- exit button
- ending report

## future ideas
- Wrap every sentence with a 'span' tag via regex, get the parent element of the selected article field, and voila, we have the context sentence.
- Dashboard with stats for each article. Correct / wrong answers percentage. The latest mistakes for each of the articles.

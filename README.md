## future ideas
- Wrap every sentence with a 'span' tag via regex, get the parent element of the selected article field, and voila, we have the context sentence.
- Dashboard with stats for each article. Correct / wrong answers percentage. The latest mistakes for each of the articles.
- Custom `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` function
